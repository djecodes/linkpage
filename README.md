## Overview of this project
- On Tech Twitter or other social media platforms, in people's bio it's not rare to see a link to a <a href="https://linktr.ee/">Linktree Page</a>, a single page for multiple links that normally wouldn't fit in a bio.
- I wanted to speedbuild a linktree-like page of my personal social media profiles using only HTML, CSS.
- I choose HTML and CSS for this project so that I can review the fundamentals.
- The font used in this project is Poppins, imported from Google Fonts.
- The icons used in this project is <a href="https://remixicon.com/">Remix Icons</a>

## What's next to improve this project?
- Adding media queries to fit the screen of tablet devices (~560px and up.) 
- Adding a 3 second transistion effect to the card for a smoother experience.
